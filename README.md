FoxTracker

Simple project and task tracker

Being a fan of Kanban technique for task tracking, I have created this application as a Kanban board.

First Screen - Projects 

User can create, view, update and delete projects

Second Screem - Tasks

Here tasks are put into 3 lists based on their status - TODO, Doing and Done.

Tasks can be create, view, update, delete and drag and drop from one list to another which updates their states.

It is a single page application built with Backbone.js

Framework used - Backbone.js for MVC modelling.

Storage - localStorage using backbone-localstorage.js 

All required functionality has been implemented - 

Projects - CRUD
Tasks - CRUD
Timer for tasks
Responsive layout for smartphone and tablets

Additional - 

Drag n Drop tasks from one list to another. (Only for desktop considering time constraints)


Lots of improvements can be done, to name a few - 

Optimisation : Image sprites

Optimisation : Using css preprocessors - sass or less

Optimisation : JS concatenation and minification

Feature : to Star a task so that is stays on top of list

Feature : progress bar on project view - to show project completeness

Feature : Associate team members with tasks
